Cases and Configurations

A case is a broader set of configurations. Case is usually limited to a single
instrument. Configuration consists of some particular geometry, atmosphere and
solar angles.

These are just some words with which to organize the cross-section databases and
intermediate input files.

For example, case could be called "ALTIUS" and a configuration could be called
"only-rayleigh".
